This project is Heart Disease Classification by comparing 3 classification algorithms namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and XGBoots. 
The comparison of the 3 algorithm models is compared in each data handling and based on the resulting accuracy. 
This project uses raw data taken from public datasets.
